## Week 5 

### A

We dedicated the first half of the day to a 'pre-screening' of  [*Task 2 works-in-progress*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1scKvMRQx8&t=9s)


### B

This week we asked to pick a text from [*online reader*](http://digbeyond.com/readme/phplist.php?course=Code-Words) as our final project. After done a bit of reading, we worte down some summaries about *What is the text about? Who was the author? Why did you choose this text?* on this [*PPT sildes*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tF9j3J75aVpLWOs6R_vCNQty8WjL-_AfgO9TgyKLoq0/edit#slide=id.g91a5b1fc32_16_0) 

The OK text and GRAMMATRON francinate me the most. They are both written by Mark Amerika. I can see a strong connection between two of them. They give me the same frustration by indicating there is no chocie but to follow the experience.(although it did offer an obvious  YES/NO option in Ok text)

**Ok text**

the pop up “warning” texts that we often briefly read then press “OK” to close. 

**GRAMMATRON**

I found this interative [*web page*](http://www.grammatron.com) online, not sure if it's the original Art work.

Part of Grammatron is a companion theory site called "hypertext consciousness" The story introduces readers to Abe Golam, a pioneering Net artist who creates Grammatron, a writing machine. Endowed not with the Word (as in the original myth) but with forbidden data—a specially coded Nanoscript—the creature becomes a digital being that "contains all of the combinatory potential of all the writings." The Grammatronis the personification of the Golem, which is also a personification of Amerika the artist. While the Golem and its environment have been depicted in any number of literary adaptations and works, in GRAMMATRON, Mark Amerika creates a seemingly infinite, recombinant (text-)space in the electrosphere.

I tried to playaround with mouseX mouseY translate rotate later on and  [Play here](https://raymondvonz.github.io/CodeWords/W5/spin/).
The 10 Arc shapes are spinning by themselves 

Here is another attempt using map function.
