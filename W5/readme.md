### B

This week we asked to pick a text from [*online reader*](http://digbeyond.com/readme/phplist.php?course=Code-Words) as our final project. After done a bit of reading, we worte down some summaries about *What is the text about? Who was the author?

The OK text and GRAMMATRON francinate me the most. They are both written by Mark Amerika. I can see a strong connection between two of them. They give me the same frustration by indicating there is no chocie but to follow the experience.(although it did offer an obvious  YES/NO option in Ok text)
