## Week 2 Summary

### A
**Hunting modular typeface designs** 
At the beginning of the Week2, we did a [*Group Activity*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.g8ed135ac50_18_0) searching for existing modular typeface.

**Friki Display** - inspired by Bauhuas movement, is the so called the most useless typeface in the world

*This is my experiment with animation and shapes.*

**MuirMcNeil** - make typefaces that work in mysterious but mathematical ways. Using methods that are entirely contemporary, though they can seem arcane, they explore ‘parametric design systems’. 

> McNeil says that, because of developments in type design software, their form of ‘constructed’ type is often looked down upon by professional type designers ‘as something that anybody could do – as if there’s no real quality to it’. Muir adds: ‘So when you do anything modular or geometric people go “Ugh, bitmap!”’

MuirMcNeil’s work has always sought to be about content and context, through discovery more than preconception.
