## Week 2 Summary

### A
**Hunting modular typeface designs** 
At the beginning of the Week2, we did a [*Group Activity*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.g8ed135ac50_18_0) searching for existing modular typeface.

**Friki Display** - inspired by Bauhuas movement, is the so called the most useless typeface in the world

*This is my experiment with animation and shapes.*

**MuirMcNeil** - make typefaces that work in mysterious but mathematical ways. Using methods that are entirely contemporary, though they can seem arcane, they explore ‘parametric design systems’. 

> McNeil says that, because of developments in type design software, their form of ‘constructed’ type is often looked down upon by professional type designers ‘as something that anybody could do – as if there’s no real quality to it’. Muir adds: ‘So when you do anything modular or geometric people go “Ugh, bitmap!”’

MuirMcNeil’s work has always tought to be about content and context, through discovery more than preconception.

### B

**Task 2: Re-readings in virtual space** 

Who doesn't love Animal Crossing? 

In this week. we also dive divided up the first part of House of Leaves between the 6 groups. The cutenesses of the Animal Crossing totally gets me and i decided to join the [*Wholesome Animal Crossing*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c1KexKLj99n7Z-FLky9NW8Zqkgk1uo2tdibFXJoCwYc/edit#slide=id.g8e5186eb0c_21_0) team. We tested out the recording function and can't wait to creat horror settings
