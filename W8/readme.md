### A

We presented our paper-prototypes to the class today [Here is the ppt sildes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dX_ZDAdoo_U-JSXTtUxhwClVBWJZjEu7X48fx6t4-Zc/edit#slide=id.p). I have to admit my peers are all amazingly talented. It was super inspring to see everyone’s ideas for their chosen texts.

Here is my psudeocode attempts, I know l was doing it wrong(Karen said it's too abstract). It is funny when l finished my final design and look back on this. I really made a lot of progress during the past few weeks by spending a lot of time watching coding tutorials on Youtube.

```
*Part A Typing effect (main, background,Looping)
Print text 
Play typing sound
IT IS WORTHLESS, IT IS DATA THAT WORRIES ME.
Part B Pop up ads that avoiding the mouse
Create ads
IF user moves mouse
           THEN ads move in an opposite direction 
Else  the ads moves randomly 
OT BLUE BALLS, BUDDY? SAME OLD SAME OLD? FUCK THAT SHIT MAN...
           Part C Pop up ads with Highlight text  
           IF user moves mouse
           THEN ads grow bigger
           IF mouse reach the highlight area
           THEN you die
WELL,YEAH ABE-BABES,WE’RE ALL HOME NOW! HOME ALONE! TOUCH ME YOU DIE!”*
```

### B

In the next few days I tried my best to get comfortable with coding. I put my ideas for the final design aside and just inmerse myslf in writing code. I am those kind of guy who learns from mistakes and pratices. I feel like l really need to hand on and start to make mistakes( or you can say create bugs)

Attempt 1 

I Created a function named countdown that accepts two parameters: number and message. Displaying the countdown from the specified number to 0. At the end of the countdown, the given information for each parameter will be displayed on the screen.
