I have to admit my peers are all amazingly talented. It was super inspring to see everyone’s ideas for their chosen texts.

Here is my psudeocode attempts, I know l was doing it wrong(Karen said it's too abstract). It is funny when l finished my final design and look back on this. I really made a lot of progress during the past few weeks by spending a lot of time watching coding tutorials on Youtube.
