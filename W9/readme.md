### A

We delivered the work-in-progress code for our project this week and then Karen demonstrated some sketches using textToPoint() and text appearing over time.

Here is my pop up ads attempt ( work in progress ).

I have no ideal how to make it brouncing around while avoiding the mouse.
But after done some youtube tutorials,I suddenly realised that instead of make the window avoiding the mouse I can use the radome function to generate a new window when my mouse is approaching to the close button. haha problem solved.

### B

I was super clear with what l wanna achieve through coding thanks to the paper prototyping. So I decided to break the final design into 3 parts), Luckly with the help of Karen and youtube tutorials. I figured most of them out.

Here is my typing effect attempt.

I got a lot of help from my Housemate Karen and Celia on this one. Thanks A lot!

Me and Celia struggled a lot in this because karen's original code is using spit function and it's keep typing one line a world and it took us a while to make it type horizontally. After that, we realised that we need to put in a rightside margin in the code so that it can type paragraph. We thought about manually breaking the long sentences and repeat the code from the frist attempt but failed and then we have another thought on declaring a new var makes sentence able to measure the distence between text and right margin. With the code from Karen (again) we mannaged to get the effect we want.

Here is my enlarge windoe attempt.
When mouse reaches window then the window grow bigger
