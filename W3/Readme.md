## Week 3 Summary

# A

This weeks class staring with expolaring Electronic literature. 

>Electronic literature or digital literature is a genre of literature encompassing works created exclusively on and for digital devices, such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones. A work of electronic literature can be defined as "a construction whose literary aesthetics emerge from computation", "work that could only exist in the space for which it was developed/written/coded—the digital space.

Can not be printed - because elements crucial to the text are unable to be carried over onto a printed version.

I found this website when doing the research [*Scrolling Text Time Waster*](http://patorjk.com/misc/scrollingtext/timewaster.php). At fist, I tought the text is generating when you scolling the web. but it turned out to be a long page with pre-arragnged text. But it would be fun to see how scrolling can be incorporated into my major project. 

[*AI Dungeon*](https://play.aidungeon.io/) Is also something fun to play with, which reminds me of a website l used to do my dairy as a part of High School homework. Similar to this [*Bulls**t Generator*](https://suulnnka.github.io/BullshitGenerator/index.html). It can automatically Generates stories based on your topic entry.

Now l am imagine something that can generate SKO or Rationales

**Working Progress of Task 2**

 We interpreted chapter three of the text, Breaking it into two different sectors with 8 parts each. The book follows a structure where all three (Editor (Commentary on both Johnny and Zampano), Johnny’s story (main timeline) & Zampano’s story (“The Navidson Record” )). 
Fonts used to separate these three as the stories unfolds. This is a way to have three timelines of three different stories but hell it gets confusing at times. 

>Writing Style/Structure:
Multiple editions were created: colour, braille, black and white, two two-colour editions, an ‘incomplete’ edition (no colour, no index). Individual mysteries are created throughout these editions - 98 index entries marked with DNE (does not exist), etc. Creating a gap between meaning and discovery, the readers too become the characters - like Johnny, searching for answers and questioning reality. Different fonts used for different characters (Editor, Johnny & Zampano) \\

Based on different fonts used in the book, we break the story into SectionA (Written in courier new(maybe) from Johnny Truant’s view) and SectionB(Section B  Written in times new roman, from the writing/perspective of Zampano)

Here is some examples we found online 

[*New Horizons | Animal Crossing Sci-Fi Movie Trailer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXc_9ikGkl0).

[*Animal Crossing | Horror Movie Trailer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVx3Xp9OVE8).

[*Animal crossing new horizons hidden cutscene*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHzucflNQaM).

We have noticed that movements and expressions made by each of the characters / Conversations in the game / Subtitles / Voice overs / Scene settings... can help to tell the story in animal crossing.
