Some reflections l wrote ( I hate writing )

As a graphic designer, I always feel like coding is something I wonâ€™t touch till the day l died. I am so used to design in the Adobe suites. If I am using After Effects to recreate my final project. I will, with no doubt, end up with something which looks more fascinating. However, I kept thinking recently that Are we really designing/creating or we just do whatever we can do which looks good in Adobe suites? Sticking with the Adobe somehow limits my design outcome and have a negative influence on how far my imagination will go. I constantly end up repeating the same tricks that I am familiar with and comfortable with.

By studying this course, I was given the opportunity to jump out of the box and stay far away from my comfort zone. I not only learned how to use code to generate artworks but also had a few fresh thoughts on design thinking. A 12 Weeks studio class is definitely not enough for me to become an expert in Coding JavaScript, but It helps me to become a better designer by thinking differently and logically. I am not sure if will go deeper or not in the future as a coder. But as a designer, I will consider it as a little spark in my design life, something that helps me think about how to design, something that brings unexacting but absolutely gorgeous outcomes.

Last but not the least, thank you, Andy and Karen, for opening the door of the CodeWords to us during the Lockdown. It was a pleasant journey.
