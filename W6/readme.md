## Week 6

### A

In this week, I have been reading GRAMMATRON over and over again and trying to pick some sentence that appears to me. Here are some really powerful text.

> **IT IS WORTHLESS, he entered his opening salvo of this particular day into the electrosphere. Then he backspaced over the word WORTHLESS and typed in DATA. By the time he was finished with his first line, it read IT IS DATA THAT WORRIES ME.**



This pic is from the original GRAMMATRON website. By simply click the highlighting text or link you are able to continue reading. I feel like it can be bringed into my final project given that clicking is one of the major interactive features.

Pop up window may also be something that I would try. By reading the text, I can feel how annoying it would be when ads is popping from nowhere in digital and you have nowhere to hide. I wanna visualise the frustration and highlight the pop up ads experience.


> **GOT BLUE BALLS, BUDDY? SAME OLD SAME OLD? FUCK THAT SHIT MAN....GO MONSTER! MONSTER IS THE MOST POTENT FORM OF DAMI- ANA EVER GROWN. AND WE GOT IT HERE IN CUM CITY! TAKE A TRIP TO CUM CITY AND WATCH YOUR LIFE TURN FROM SHITTY TO . . . WORSE!**

> **STOP FUCKING AROUND. I DIDN’T COME HERE TO LISTEN TO YOUR DEPRESSIVE BULLSHIT. YOUR HANG-UPS ARE EASY TO READ, BABY. YOU NEED PUSSY. HOT WET UNINTERRUPTED NON-STOP FOREVER-IN-YOUR- FACE PUSSY. COME TO ME, JACKIE JILL, UP MY HILL, TO FETCH A PAIL OF STEAMY, HOT, CUM-WATER. COME ON BABY, YOU’VE BEEN PISSING ALL YOUR GODDAMN TIME AWAY. YOU WANNA GET LAID?**

> **At which point three more slo-mo sweeps of the tantalizing tongue come across the screen, and then her access code burns brightly in dark red: JJ@900SEX.COM**

> **BREAKING NEWS!
MACRO WORLD MEDIA DECLARES WAR! PAY PER VIEW ON CHANNEL X! CHECK NOW FOR PRICES . . .**

### B

I did a bit resarch on pop up Ads in vitural worlds.A lot of Sci-fi movie and TV shows have similar scenario where people are bombarded with Advertising.For example One of the Black Mirror shorts, "15 Million Merits" handles this extremely well. It depicts very intrusive advertising in a dystopic future. Most flat surfaces double as screens, and intrusive ads (that cost money to skip) appear wherever you happen to be looking. One of them forms a fairly major plot point.

and some fun reading [Pop-up ads: Why everyone hates them and why they’ll never die](https://marketingland.com/pop-up-ads-why-everyone-hates-them-and-why-theyll-never-die-273343).
