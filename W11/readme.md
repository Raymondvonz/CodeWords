### A

This week we dedicated to documenting and presenting our final projects.

I wrote a short statement of my design.

It is worthless is an artwork exploring both pros and cons of reading in Digital space, inspired by the Internet novel GRAMMATRON. Although Multi-media devices may bring reading to the next level by creating immersive and interactive disseminations, something we can not ignore is that we are more likely to be distracted from the text itself. 

As is depicted in the GRAMMATRON, people are bombarded with Advertising in Digital space. By reading the text I selected, I am expecting people to sense the frustration as well as the desperation when they find out there is no way to hide in the Digital space. I want people to be annoyed and start to think about do they really need reading in the digital space? 

The ideal of ‘’IT IS WORTHLESS. IT IS DATA THAT WORRIES ME.’’ is conveyed throughout the experience. Three windows are expecting to distract reading as well as to interrupt the user experience. However whether you want it or not, it actually became parts of the digital reading. Despite the texts in the pop-up windows that may sound a little x-rated, they are from GRAMMATRON.The overall experience can be described as " When you are in the middle of reading and then, suddenly, you realize that a giant pop-up ad is blocking some part of the text, forcing you to look at it, and pay attention to it" You get annoyed and try to close it but the pop-up window 

A grows bigger 
B disappear for one second and then reappear 
C runs away from your mouse

which leaves you no choice but to deal with it.

Something I changed:

After I re-read the GRAMMATRON. It came across to me that I need to add another pop up window that contains the last paragraph of the novel.

>"BREAKING NEWS! MACROWORLDMEDIA DECLARES WAR! PAY PER VIEW ON CHANNEL X! CHECK NOW FOR PRICES...

I decided to make this window transparent when mouse is hovering above. It will definately add a little spark to the final artwork. 

Sound effect is finally added. I wasn't sure about whether l should include sound or not. But after seen everone's work (a lot of them do have sounds in their design).I picked a really anonnying sound conbined with mousePressd fuction to make the whole exprience even more torturing. I know Readers will try to press their mouse to close the pop up window and I am expecting them to stressed out lol.
