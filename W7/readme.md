## Week 7

### A

This week's class starts with paper prototyping, we worked in a group to share our ideal on how we gonna interpret the text we picked and how these prototypes will help us develop our code. I found that doing prototypes are helpful for me to quickly test my initial ideas. They can be quickly modified, which means l can realize a bounch of my ideals easily. I made a stop motion gif showing my paper prototype.

The ideal was to create a narrative for reader by using interative windows. Reading can be so different in digital space.

> A new generation of digital writers is building on video games, incorporating their interactive features—and cognitive sparks—into novelistic narratives that embrace the capabilities of our screens and tablets.
