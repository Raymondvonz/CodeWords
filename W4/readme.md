## Week 4 Summary

What Is [*Aspect Ratio*](https://nofilmschool.com/Aspect-Ratio-Examples-For-Filmmakers)?

The aspect ratio of an image describes the width and height. It's usually written as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9. It can also be written with an “x” between the numbers. Like 3x4. 

Sometimes, aspect ratio change in order to show a change in perspective. This method also helps to catch the viewers’ attention and keep them focused.

The aspect ratio of a movie can have a significant effect on how the scenes in the movie are perceived by the viewer. Changing the ratio during a movie (as in Interstellar, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.) can be an effective way to signal a thematic change.
