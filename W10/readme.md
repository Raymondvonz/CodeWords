## Week 10 

### A

I cannot believe it's already week 10.

This week, we had a small presentations of our code-in-progress.I have been woriking with Celia coz we all have the typing effect involved in our final design. At first i have no clue how to make that happen until karen showed us a pice of her codes. In addition to that, I successfully figured out how to code the second window which is when mouse is getting close, the window grow bigger.

IF the mouse is outside the frame
THEN fill black & framewitdh+ 1
Else fill blue & bouncing 
IF Frame reaches the window width& height
THEN bounce back
