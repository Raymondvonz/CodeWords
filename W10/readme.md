## Week 10 

### A

I cannot believe it's already week 10.

This week, we had a small presentations of our code-in-progress. It was inspiring to see others work.

I have been woriking with Celia coz we all have the typing effect involved in our final design. At first i have no clue how to make that happen until karen showed us a pice of her codes. In addition to that, I successfully figured out how to code the second window which is when mouse is getting close, the window grow bigger.

IF the mouse is outside the frame
THEN fill black & framewitdh+ 1
Else fill blue & bouncing 
IF Frame reaches the window width& height
THEN bounce back

Now l am faceing the problem with how to put all my codes together. I found that a lot of bugs starting to appear when I tried to put everthing together.The codes are geting extremely longer. two of my windows are overlaping. I spend most of the time debuging. One of my firend suggested me to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com),which allows me to debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.
